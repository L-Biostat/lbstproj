# Moves a report to a different location and rename it uniquely

Move the report file generated by
[`run_report()`](https://l-biostat.github.io/lbstproj/reference/run_report.md)
from the `reports/` directory to the `results/reports/` directory,
renaming it to include:

- the current date

- the project version (from the DESCRIPTION file)

- a unique identifier if a file with the same name already exists This
  function helps to archive reports systematically.

## Usage

``` r
move_rename_report(old_path, overwrite = FALSE)
```

## Arguments

- old_path:

  The current path of the report file to be moved (with extension in the
  filename)

- overwrite:

  Logical; if `TRUE`, overwrite existing report files in the
  `results/reports/` directory. If `FALSE`, a unique name will be
  generated to avoid overwriting, by appending a counter to the filename
  (e.g. `_001`, `_002`, etc.). Default is `FALSE`.

## Value

The path to the moved and renamed report file.
